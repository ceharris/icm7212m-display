icm7212-display
===============

A four-digit LED display module based around the Maxim 7212M display
driver.

The ICM7212M is an LED display driver component designed to allow up to
four 7-segment LED displays to be controlled via parallel microprocessor
interface.

This project combines the 40-pin PDIP package for the ICM7212M along with
four 7-segment LED displays, and a trim pot, on a 70mm x 50mm board with 
either pin headers or pin sockets for the bus interface. This allows the 
ICM7212M to be connected directly to the bus of a computer system, 
addressed like any other I/O device, and thus providing an easy-to-use 
hardware display for debugging, status, or other applications.
